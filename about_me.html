        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started my journey into code fairly recently. What first began as a hobby soon replaced my full-time job. I graduated from college with all the intentions of being an accountant. Surprisingly, it's a little bit <strong>boring</strong>. It was the knack for numbers that tricked me into accounting. It came easy so I figured that must mean I like it. After graduation I continued working for the agency that I had interned for until mid 2016. I ended up separating from that comapny and jumped right into Epicodus. What sparked the transition? Essentially, I decided I liked coding more than accounting.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal for my career is basically to be happy with what I am doing. I'm happy putting myself through the rigor of Epicodus because it means I might learn if I'm happy with a life of programming. For the moment I like it, but later down the road things may change. I would like to be in game development, which was another factor in me making the transition. Though, that one is on the back burner for now.
